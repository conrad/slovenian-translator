# Slovenian Translator

This is an Alexa skill currently for learning the Slovenian word for English words. You are able to ask your Amazon Echo, "Alexa, ask the Slovene the word for train." Alexa responds, "The word for train is zlak, spelled z l a k."

In order to use these files to create your own similar application, you must:
- run npm install
- create a zip file from all the files, including the node_modules (but not necessarily the package.json or this README.md)
- upload the zip file on a Lambda function on you AWS developer portal.
- Set up your speech interface for making requests to this Lamdba function through Alexa or another interface however you like. To set up an Alexa interface go to developer.amazon.com

Maybe I'll deploy this skill once I populate the dictionary with more words--just adding a few a day. I hope to add phrases as well. Enjoy.
